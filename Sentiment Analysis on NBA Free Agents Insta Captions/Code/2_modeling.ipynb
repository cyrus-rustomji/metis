The untrue negative comments....stories...and coverage will never phase me as a player, nor as a person. This cover means a lot to me for what it symbolizes! My early career struggles for one, and the constant scrutiny for playing for “Doc” aka my pops lol. In a weird way I’m thankful for it.....the early career struggles and the hate. It has helped mold me into the player and person I am today. It’s apart of what drives me to keep getting better besides the obvious, To Win!! My early career struggles taught me a lot! Taught me I wasn’t as good as I thought I was and that I needed to work harder to get much better. A slice of humble pie sort of speak. I’m thankful for it because it really made me grow tougher skin. Tough skin that i needed to have if I were to ever play for my pops at this level. People seem to forget I was the number 1 high school player in America....or a Lottery pick in the draft. These same people judge me now before watching...and can’t realize no matter who I play for that I’m out there on that court alone like every other player. But that’s fine! Honestly that’s real. It’s a what have you done for me lately world. Who cares about the past....doesn’t do anything for us now. So in that case, who cares about the early career struggles, the bad numbers, the no playoff appearances!! I’m here now and I’m going! Do To hard work and God first, my family’s support, great team mates and coaches over the years who taught me right. And lastly the will to be the greatest me I can be, and hopefully 1 day Win a ring. I appreciate the the people who do support me, means more than u know. And to the people who don’t... to each its own. But just know...I’m not stoping! I’m not perfect, far from it, still will have bad games and good games like every other player. But overall Imma keep hoopin, keep getting better, and keep doing as much as I can to help the team win!! Again I’m thankful as always!!! @dimemagazine  Thanks for the opportunity.
