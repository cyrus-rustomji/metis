or the clips I really appreciate you     No matter what people say, I m going to keep working   keep grinding and keep getting better  The untrue negative comments    stories   and coverage will never phase me as a player, nor as a person  This cover means a lot to me for what it symbolizes  My early career struggles for one, and the constant scrutiny for playing for  Doc  aka my pops lol  In a weird way I m thankful for it     the early career struggles and the hate  It has helped mold me into the player and person I am today  It s apart of what drives me to keep getting better besides the obvious, To Win   My early career struggles taught me a lot  Taught me I wasn t as good as I thought I was and that I needed to work harder to get much better  A slice of humble pie sort of speak  I m thankful for it because it really made me grow tougher skin  Tough skin that i needed to have if I were to ever play for my pops at this level  People seem to forget I was the number 1 high school player in America    or a Lottery pick in the draft  These same people judge me now before watching   and can t realize no matter who I play for that I m out there on that court alone like every other player  But that s fine  Honestly that s real  It s a what have you done for me lately world  Who cares about the past    doesn t do anything for us now  So in that case, who cares about the early career struggles, the bad numbers, the no playoff appearances   I m here now and I m going  Do To hard work and God first, my family s support, great team mates and coaches over the years who taught me right  And lastly the will to be the greatest me I can be, and hopefully 1 day Win a ring  I appreciate the the people who do support me, means more than u know  And to the people who don t    to each its own  But just know   I m not stoping  I m not perfect, far from it, still will have bad games and good games like every other player  But overall Imma keep hoopin, keep getting better, and keep doing as much as I can to help the team win   Again I m thankful as always     dimemagazine  Thanks for the opportunity  Sorry to get a little deep in here lol  Just like to tell my truth before
