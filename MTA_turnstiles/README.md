## Summary

The problem we are trying to solve is how we can maximize the amount of individuals attending the upcoming fundraising gala. We used NYC MTA foot traffic data, Yelp, and Meetup data to analyze which stations see the most traffic, along with placing this stations on a map from Google Maps. The goal of this project was to place outreach teams at locations that have a promise of reaching an audience who believes in their mission. The solution we came up with was an aggregate score for each station based on the Yelp data, Meetup data, and amount of traffic each station saw from the NYC MTA data.
